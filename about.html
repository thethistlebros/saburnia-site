    <main><section><p>Saburnia, the brainchild of brothers Cameron and Devin Thistle, is an American band that leans into the beautiful imperfections of human nature to create an honest, handmade sound. The Los Angeles-based brothers grew up harmonizing and passing instruments back and forth in Haymarket, Virginia, eventually discovering their love for writing songs and making music together. Since building their catalog in the form of voice memos, they've honed their sound through countless performances around the country, both as a duo and in a band setting with their closest friends. If you asked Cam & Dev what their favorite part of it all is, they would tell you it's the live show and the community that surrounds it — and they might even get carried away talking about how it feels to share a one-of-a-kind moment with those in attendance. Now, with their debut album on the horizon, the brothers look forward to expanding that community by finally releasing studio recordings of the greatest hits from their live sets, opening the door for people everywhere to be a part of the world they've named after their mother: Saburnia.</p></section></main>
